<h2>My Favorite Artist</h2>

<p>
    I don't exactly have favorite artist, because I feel like I may change my mind any second. But thinking about<br>
    it, I catch myself on thought that I listen mostly to those guys, Twenty One Pilots, musicial duo I listen to mostly.<br>
    The group was formed in 2009 by lead vocalist Tyler Joseph along with Nick Thomas and Chris Salih, who both left in 2011.<br>
    Since their departure, the line-up has consisted of Tyler Joseph and drummer Josh Dun. Those guys created a story by writing<br>
    songs. You can find more about their lore online but in short The lore of Twenty One Pilots' songs centers on the fictional world<br>
    of Dema, a city ruled by nine Bishops who promote a religion of "Vialism." The story of Twenty One Pilots is often interpreted as<br> 
    a metaphor for mental health struggles, particularly depression and anxiety.
    <h4> Some their songs that I listen to often lately are:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Tear in My Heart</li>
        <li>Drum Show</li>
        <li>Downstairs</li>
        <li>Days lie Dormant</li>
        <li>Shy Away</li>
    </ul>
